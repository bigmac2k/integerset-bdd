# BDDStab - BDD-based Integer Set Library

This library contains a BDD-based integer set implementation that efficiently handles large sets of integers of the fixed or dynamic bit-width, i.e., 2^n-bit integers as well as n-bit integers.
API documentation is available at [github](https://bigmac2k.github.io/integerset-bdd/latest/api/cc/sven/index.html).

More information, as well as publication are available at the website of the [Hamburg University of Technology's Institute for Softwaresystems](https://www.tuhh.de/sts/research/projects/bddstab.html).
